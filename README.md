# 2048clone
I got bored. Made this in a day. My implementation of 2048, using P5 and vanilla JS.


#Thing I could add
    - Hichscore tracker
    - User can enter board size (supports an NxN game)
    - Use proper color scheme
    - add animations when you swipe
    - fix gesture with mouse (currently removed)
